I recently read Kyle Simpson's **excellent** [free You Don't Know JS book series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) and to me it felt like a *JavaScript: The Good Parts* for a new generation of JavaScript coders. The only problem I had with it was that it was so full of revelations and important expositions that by the time I finished the last book in the series, I could hardly remember anymore what the first one was even about.

So I decided to read it a second time, and once again I'm just absolutely floored by the knowledge bombs Simpson keeps dropping on his readers. If you haven't checked it out by now, I **highly** recommend you do so, no matter how well you think you already know JS!

In fact, I like his books so much I'm now going through his [Advanced JavaScript course on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/advanced-javascript) as well. I'm not sorry to say I've postponed the full-time job hunt I'll soon be embarking on for just a little bit longer, until I've soaked up more of his JS expertise.

Anyway, I just wanted to do my bit and promote Kyle Simpson's stuff. The books are free to read on GitHub, but you can [buy printed versions from O'Reilly](http://search.oreilly.com/?i=1;q=kyle+simpson;q1=Books;x=0;x1=t1;y=0&act=fc_contenttype_Books). PluralSight is subscription-based (it's originally from Frontend Masters so of course [you can get it there as well](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-javascript/)), but the Advanced JavaScript course alone is well worth the membership fee for a month!
