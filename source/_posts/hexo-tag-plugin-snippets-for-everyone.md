As I noted in my last post about Hexo, I'm not a big fan anymore of fancy CMS-style administration panels for blogging. Nowadays, I do pretty much all my writing in vim using markdown.

This is actually a pretty big deal for me because I used to be a professional writer/translator, so I've spent a *lot* of time in various administration panels and WYSIWYG editors. If only I'd known back then what I know now: that the combination of vim and markdown blows them all out of the water..

Either way, snippets is what I wanted to talk about here. Since I started blogging again, I've been making new [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) snippets whenever I came across new opportunities to use them.

I'm blogging with Hexo so most of [my snippets](https://github.com/greg-js/vim-tag-plugin-snippets) are centered around Hexo's tag plugins. But earlier, I decided to clean them up, make sure I got all of them and ported them to [Snipmate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate) (the other popular format for vim snippets) as well.

<!-- more -->

I had some issues getting Snipmate to play nice with my other plugins so I couldn't test them out. They should work, but in case I got some of the snippet syntax wrong, send me a pull request. Same goes for if you have more snippets to add to the mix.

Anyway, [here are the snippets](https://github.com/greg-js/vim-tag-plugin-snippets). Hope they're of some use to someone. If not, oh well, I'll just use them myself, thank you very much.

Oh, and one more thing, these snippets don't include the more obvious markdown syntax. That's just because there are already plenty of other repos for that.
