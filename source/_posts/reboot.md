So I just took a four-month break from JavaScript to focus on studying math, core computer science concepts and algorithms, as well as getting a Linux certification. But now I'm delving right back into the wonderful world of JavaScript.

I fully realize *very* few people will actually be reading this, so I won't go into too much detail right now, but for the sake of future reference - if only for myself - I'll write a few paragraphs here about my decision to scrap my old blog and start this new one.

Those among you I sent this link to probably know I ran a small personal blog before. It was a simple and personal WordPress blog, hosted for free on Heroku, and it ran for about a year, during which I progressed from being a professional writer/translator, over my early forays into programming, to my decision to become a full-time student of web development.

As I continued on my path, it became clear to me that, although many subjects in computer science had gripped me by the throat and refused to let me go, ultimately my heart belongs to the most popular language in the world right now. Loved by some, hated by many, used by everyone, but so very misunderstood, she is the apple of my eye: JavaScript. Yet despite my love for her, I took a break from her four months ago.

The reason was simple: I felt unready, unworthy even, to embrace her fully. My background in studying computer science was almost non-existent. Many say you don't need math to do JavaScript, or that you can be a great programmer without studying CS. I don't know if that's true or not. The truth is, I just *wanted* to understand why some code runs better than others, why one piece of code is faster than another seemingly equivalent one. And to do that, I had to go back and study the basics.

I'll probably go into some more detail about this at some point in the near future, but suffice it to say that I took time off from JavaScript to focus on studying calculus (which in retrospect was probably unnecessary), discrete math, algorithms and Python. I also decided to delve deeper into Linux and vim, and got certified as a sysadmin by the Linux Foundation. That was last week.

My original plan was to simply get back into what I was doing before. But four months is a *long* time, not just for JavaScript, but for myself too. Last week I looked at my blog again and thought, what am I doing? Am I really writing a JavaScript blog in WordPress now? I also looked at my old posts and noticed that they were all over the place. Too much personal stuff, not enough code - I felt like it wasn't really *about* anything anymore, so I decided not to migrate my posts and start anew instead.

Obviously this is a work in progress. I set up a new Digital Ocean server and pointed it to this domain name (which I'd bought a while ago - by the way JS are my middle and last name initials as well as standing for JavaScript, how fitting is that, eh?). Then I looked around for blogging options, flirted with Ghost and Metalsmith, but settled on hexo. I'm just using the defaults now, but I'll eventually make it my new home on the interwebs. I'll move over some of my projects and make a portfolio site too.

But all in due time. Right now I'm setting things up and relearning JavaScript. Actual content will come later. I just wanted to get this first post out of the way and explain why I disappeared for a while and why I decided to start with a clean slate. My blog is dead, long live my blog!
