If you're a React person and you use vim to edit files, *and* you use the [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) plugin for inserting snippets, *and* you're also using ES6 syntax to make those sweet, sweet React components you've got there, then you're in luck because I just pushed [some snippets to GitHub](https://github.com/greg-js/vim-react-es6-snippets) just for you!

The Readme links to the people originally responsible for the other snippets. I just enabled them for UltiSnips users too and updated them to the new ES6 syntax as recommended in the React docs.
