It's been while since my last activity here. The reason is I've been out visiting my parents across the English Channel, hiking with my girlfriend in German-speaking Belgium, and then I topped it all off with a long weekend trip with friends in the sunny south of Spain.

It was my original intention to keep working and posting while abroad, but while there I ended up deciding against it, partly due to just being too tired at the end of every day, and partly to give my mind a rest from JS on my time away from the PC -- though I did lug around a Chromebook with SSH access to a dev server everywhere I went.

So I've not been coding much for over two weeks now and I feel a little rusty. After I submit this post, I will gather my thoughts and once again attack my now neglected to-do list. Said list will need a few more tasks added first though, because I discovered that travel-time abroad, while not good for doing actual sit-down work, is actually great for other things important to a budding coder.

Traveling is great, but often there is a lot of dead time. Sitting in airplanes, trains and buses, waiting for flights and rides, waiting for travel-mates to all take a shower before heading out to town.. You can't use that time for doing real work, but you *can* listen to podcasts or catch up on articles, so that's what I did. A lot of.

What I'm saying is that even with the best of intentions, trying to solve complex problems while on holiday is probably a big mistake. Dead travel time is unpredictable, variable in length and often occurs in loud, distracting environments, while any programmer knows that the *coding zone* is not something one just snaps in and out of at will.

Perhaps I'm just stating the obvious here, but to me it was a revelation. I was worried before I left that I would spend over two weeks doing nothing, so promised myself I'd work. But when I tried to use dead time for work, it turned out to be more of an exercise in frustration. When I switched to podcasts and articles instead, everything clicked again. My dead time was useful. I moved through my huge backlog of articles and tutorials and I caught up on my podcast playlist.

Conclusion: if you're on holiday and feel like you should be doing *something* useful during the dead parts of the day, but struggle with getting into the zone, open your bookmarks or your podcast app instead! As for me, I may not have solved any problems or contributed to open source in the ~16 days I've been gone, but hey, all that dead time adds up so I've used it to read dozens of articles I feared I would never get to, caught up on [JS-Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) and [The Changelog](https://changelog.com) episodes I'd missed and went through half of the [Getting Started With Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) tutorial. Not too shabby!

But now, back to the real world! Next post I'll be back to actual content again, I swear!
