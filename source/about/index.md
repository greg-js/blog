Hi, I'm **Greg**ory **J**. **S**cheerlinck, though the JS may as well stand for JavaScript because that's what I'm all about.

It wasn't always though. Up until about a year and a half ago, I was a professional freelance writer/translator. It sounds unbelievable even to myself, but over the years, I have written and published thousands of articles online. Writing was my bread and butter for most of my twenties.

I graduated from university with a bachelor's degree in History and a master's degree in Management and thus most of my writing was originally centered around those subjects. My interests began to shift to other topics however, and technology became my primary focus.

At some point during early 2014, I decided to trade in my word processor for a code editor. It wasn't because I'd begun to hate writing. I made the switch because I finally realized that I really wanted something else out of life - and that something else was programming.

I gradually reduced my writing workload as I resigned myself to the life of a self-taught CS-student. I learned the fundamentals, I did a lot of online courses, I even went back to study math and broke my head over algorithm design (and will be doing more of that as I go along). But after months and months of studying theory, I decided somewhere in late 2015 that it was time to stop learning so much and start doing more -- at least more things that go beyond practice projects.

My goal is to enter the industry as a web developer (preferably backend or full-stack) in the coming months. My primary reason for starting this blog is to document what I've been working on to get the experience I need to get that first job. I've got plenty of secondary reasons, mind you, but my overriding goal is employment as a professional deveoper.

I know it's going to be hard and I know my "formal" education is far from over. I'm still spending most of my days reading and practicing. But blogging, building and contributing to open source is taking up an increasingly large chunk by the week and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Bear with me as I build this site up and fill it with the fruits of my mental labor. Observe my progress, read my code and cheer me on as I reach my goals! Or.. you know, just read an article here and there. Whatever works for you.
